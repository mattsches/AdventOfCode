# Advent of Code 2018

## Day 6

### Part One

So this was lying around for two weeks after I first tried to solve it. Life interfered. But I've solved it now :)

My first attempt was pretty flawed, I didn't even get the grid right for a long time. And when I managed this, I had no idea how to detect finite areas and the largest area.

Today, a started from scratch, created the grid, and had the crucial idea: Why not calculate two grid, one smaller and one larger, and then compare the areas of both.

Areas that are not infinite should have the same size in both grids.

### Part Two

After this, the second part was pretty straightforward: Calculating the sum of all distances for each coordinate and comparing it to a limit.

This was a fun puzzle, and even if I might not be able to solve all 24 puzzles this year, I will try to solve at least a couple more.
